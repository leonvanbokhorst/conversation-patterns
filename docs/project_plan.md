# Research Plan: Human-like Conversational Patterns in Virtual Humans

## Research Context & Goals

### Project Context

This PoC research aims to demonstrate how specific conversational patterns contribute to human-like interaction in Virtual Humans. These patterns are fundamental building blocks for creating more natural AI interactions, addressing common issues in current conversational AI systems such as rigid turn-taking, context inconsistency, and unnatural response patterns.

### Main Research Question

How can we implement and validate key human-like conversational patterns in a 2-week PoC that demonstrates measurable improvements in:

- Response coherence (measured by context consistency scores)
- Conversational flow (measured by turn-taking naturalness metrics)
- Pattern adaptation (measured by response variation indices)
- Error recovery (measured by repair strategy effectiveness)

### Research Assumptions & Limitations

- Automated metrics as proxy for human validation
  - Strengths: Consistent measurement, rapid iteration
  - Limitations: May not fully capture subjective aspects of naturalness
  - Mitigation: Design metrics based on established human interaction patterns

### Scope Constraints

- 2 week development timeline
- No access to test users
- Focus on automated validation
- Limited to key conversational patterns

### Pattern Selection & Integration Approach

### Pattern Implementation Levels

#### Full Implementation

1. **Turn-taking (PRIMARY)**
   - Complete timing model
   - Interruption handling
   - Flow management

2. **Context Awareness (PRIMARY)**
   - Full context tracking
   - Reference resolution
   - Topic management

3. **Response Variation (SECONDARY)**
   - Dynamic variation based on context
   - Style adaptation
   - Personality consistency

4. **Repair Strategies (SECONDARY)**
   - Context-aware error detection
   - Multiple recovery strategies
   - Learning from repairs

#### Lightweight Fallback Implementation

3. **Response Variation LITE**
   - Simple template-based variation
   - Fixed set of alternatives
   - Basic context checks

4. **Repair Strategies LITE**
   - Pattern-specific error detection
   - Single recovery strategy per error
   - No learning component

### Benchmarking Scenarios

1. **Full Success:** All patterns implemented
2. **Primary + One:** Two primary + one secondary pattern
3. **Primary Only:** Focus on turn-taking and context
4. **Minimal:** Turn-taking only with metrics

#### Pattern Interaction Analysis

- Hierarchy: Turn-taking → Context → Variation → Repair
- Cross-pattern impact assessment
- Conflict resolution protocols
- Performance impact tracking

#### Implementation Dependencies
