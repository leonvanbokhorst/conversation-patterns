# 🧠 Conversational Patterns Lab

> Where we teach AIs to be less awkward at parties!

## 🔬 Experiments Overview

This repo contains several experiments exploring different aspects of AI conversation:

### 1. 🎭 Narrative Mind

- Virtual humans with evolving mental models
- Memory systems that actually remember stuff (unlike that one time I forgot where I put my keys... while holding them)
- Located in: `src/narrative_mind/`

### 2. 🎯 Topic Drift

- Neural networks that try to stay on topic (better than most humans at meetings)
- Experiments with conversation flow and coherence
- Located in: `src/topic_drift/`

### 3. 🎨 Prompt Crafting

- Making LLMs respond more naturally
- Integration patterns for better conversations
- Located in: `src/prompt_crafting/`

### 4. 🎲 Response Variability

- Making AI responses less repetitive and more human-like
- Because nobody likes talking to a broken record
- Located in: `src/response-variability/`

### 5. 🤝 Conversational Patterns

- Core patterns for natural dialogue
- Located in: `src/conversational_patterns/`

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone this repo (you probably already did that, high five! ✋)
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/conversational-patts

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run experiments
# (Each directory has its own README with specific instructions)
```

## 🎯 Key Features

- Event-driven processing
- Distributed computation support
- Async LLM integration
- Real-time conversation analysis
- Memory persistence
- Natural language understanding

## 🤓 Technical Stack

- Python (because we're civilized here)
- PyTorch (for the neural magic)
- Transformers (the AI kind, not the robots in disguise)
- FastAPI (for speedy services)
- Redis (because we remember things)

## 📝 Code Standards

We keep it clean and tidy:

- Type hints (because guessing is for fortune tellers)
- Documentation (future you will thank past you)
- Tests (lots of them)
- PEP 8 (because chaos is so 2010)
