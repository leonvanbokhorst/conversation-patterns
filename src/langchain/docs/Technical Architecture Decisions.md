# Technical Architecture Decisions

## Memory System Components

### Working Memory: ConversationBufferMemory

**Choice**: LangChain's ConversationBufferMemory
**Rationale**:

- Provides simple, in-memory storage of recent conversation
- Returns messages in a format compatible with LLM prompting
- Easy to integrate with LangChain's other components
- Supports message pruning for context window management

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Custom buffer implementation: More flexible but requires more maintenance
- Raw list storage: Too simplistic, lacks built-in LLM integration
- Window buffers: Less flexible than full buffer with pruning

### Episodic Memory: Redis + ConversationSummaryMemory

**Choice**: Redis backend with LangChain's ConversationSummaryMemory
**Rationale**:

- Redis provides persistent, fast storage
- Supports key-value and list operations needed for conversation storage
- ConversationSummaryMemory automatically generates summaries
- Built-in LLM integration for intelligent summarization
- Redis Chat History implementation already available in LangChain

**Alternatives Considered**:

- PostgreSQL: More complex than needed for key-value storage
- File system: Lacks atomic operations and scalability
- In-memory only: No persistence between restarts

### Semantic Memory: Vector Store (Planned)

**Choice**: Planning to use ChromaDB or FAISS
**Rationale**:

- Efficient similarity search for knowledge retrieval
- Supports metadata filtering
- Easy integration with LangChain
- ChromaDB offers persistence and good performance
- FAISS provides high-performance pure-Python implementation

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Pinecone: Good but requires external service
- Elasticsearch: Overkill for our needs
- Custom embedding storage: Too much maintenance overhead

### Procedural Memory: Tool Registry

**Choice**: Custom dictionary-based registry with LangChain tools integration
**Rationale**:

- Simple but flexible implementation
- Easy to register and manage tools
- Compatible with LangChain's tools framework
- Supports both function and class-based tools

**Alternatives Considered**:

- Plugin system: Too complex for current needs
- Direct function storage: Lacks metadata and management features

## Integration Architecture

### Memory Coordination

```python
class CoALAMemory:
    """Central memory coordinator"""
    def __init__(self):
        self.working_memory = ConversationBufferMemory()
        self.episodic_memory = ConversationSummaryMemory()
        self.semantic_memory = VectorStore()  # To be implemented
        self.procedural_memory = ToolRegistry()
```

**Key Design Decisions**:

1. Centralized memory coordinator
2. Clear separation between memory types
3. Standardized interfaces for memory access
4. Flexible retrieval mechanisms

### Retrieval System

Planned implementation using:

1. Relevance scoring for each memory type
2. Parallel retrieval from different memories
3. Result aggregation and ranking
4. Contextual filtering based on current state

## Technical Requirements

### Infrastructure

- Redis instance for episodic memory
- Vector store service/implementation
- LLM access for summarization
- Memory management system

### Dependencies

- LangChain for core functionality
- Redis for persistence
- Vector store library (ChromaDB/FAISS)
- Pydantic for data validation

### Performance Considerations

1. Async support for concurrent memory access
2. Caching for frequent retrievals
3. Batch processing for embeddings
4. Memory cleanup and management

## Future Extensibility

### Planned Extensions

1. Memory consolidation system
2. Forgetting mechanisms
3. Cross-memory associations
4. Learning from interactions

### Integration Points

1. LLM prompt system
2. External tool connections
3. Monitoring and logging
4. State management
