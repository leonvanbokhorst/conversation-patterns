Turn 4: A few times back in college, but it's been a while. It's a fun way to stay active though! Are you an...
Turn 5: Honestly, I haven't played since high school either, so we're pretty much on equal footing. But hey,...
Turn 6: No, not yet. I've been hearing mixed reviews though. Is it worth checking out in your opinion?
