Analyzing attention patterns on sample conversations...

Analyzing conversations with different drift levels:

Low Drift (score: 0.3474):
Turn 1: You should! Oh, by the way, did you watch the documentary on Netflix about climate change?
Turn 2: Not yet, but I've heard good things about it. Have you watched it?
Turn 3: Yes, it's quite eye-opening. It made me want to start recycling more and maybe even go vegan.
Turn 4: Wow, that's a big step! I've been trying to cut down on meat too. It's not easy though.
Turn 5: Yeah, it takes time. Hey, have you seen the new movie posters for that superhero flick coming out ne...
Turn 6: Oh, no, but I've heard it's going to be really good. Are you planning to watch it?
Turn 7: Definitely! It looks like they've got some great action sequences this time around.
Turn 8: Count me in then. We can make a night out of it.

Medium Drift (score: 0.4654):
Turn 1: Oh yeah, I saw it last weekend. It was pretty good, but not great.
Turn 2: Really? I was hoping to catch a good film this weekend. What did you think about it?
Turn 3: Well, the visuals were impressive and the acting was solid, but the plot seemed a bit lackluster. 
Turn 4: That's too bad. I've heard mixed reviews about it. Maybe I'll wait for it to come out on streaming.
Turn 5: Yeah, I think you might enjoy it more if you watch it at home where you can pause and rewatch certai...
Turn 6: Good point. So, what else have you been up to lately?
Turn 7: Not much, just trying to stay busy with work and taking care of some personal errands. How about you...
Turn 8: Same here, just the usual routine. I've also been thinking about planning a short trip soon.

High Drift (score: 0.5593):
Turn 1: It was fantastic! The team really stepped up their game and managed to pull off a victory in the fin...
Turn 2: Oh, that's too bad. I love watching sports, but sometimes life gets in the way. Maybe we could plan ...
Turn 3: That's a great idea! I'd really enjoy that. Speaking of planning ahead, I'm thinking about trying ou...
Turn 4: A few times back in college, but it's been a while. It's a fun way to stay active though! Are you an...
Turn 5: Honestly, I haven't played since high school either, so we're pretty much on equal footing. But hey,...
Turn 6: No, not yet. I've been hearing mixed reviews though. Is it worth checking out in your opinion?
Turn 7: I think so! It's definitely different from anything else I've seen recently. The visuals were stunni...
Turn 8: Oh, you're writing a book? That's awesome! What's it about?

-> See figure 3 for attention patterns

Transition types:

   A. Smooth Transitions (Low Drift Example):
   - Climate doc → recycling (natural consequence)
   - Recycling → veganism (related lifestyle change)
   - Environment → entertainment (gentle pivot via "by the way")
   
   B. Medium Transitions (Medium Drift Example):
   - Movie review → streaming options (related)
   - Streaming → general life update (clear topic switch)
   - Life update → routine (natural flow)
   
   C. Abrupt Transitions (High Drift Example):
   - Sports → planning activities (context switch)
   - Activities → reviews → book writing (rapid shifts)

Attention triggers:

   A. Linguistic Markers:
   - "Oh, by the way..." (gentle transition)
   - "So, what else..." (deliberate topic change)
   - "Speaking of..." (attempted connection)
   
   B. Semantic Shifts:
   - Topic expansion (climate → recycling)
   - Topic jumping (sports → writing)
   - Topic abandonment (quick switches)

Low Drift Conversation Analysis:

    Turn Pattern:
    1. "documentary on Netflix about climate change"
        ↓ [Natural Extension]
    2. "heard good things about it"
        ↓ [Topic Deepening]
    3. "eye-opening... recycling... vegan"
        ↓ [Peak Attention Point]
    4. "big step... cut down on meat"
        ↓ [Subtle Pivot]
    5. "takes time... new movie posters"
        ↓ [Connected Flow]
    6-8. Movie discussion continuation

    Attention Pattern:
    - Lower weights on turns 1-2 (topic establishment)
    - Peak at turns 4-5 (transition point)
    - Balanced distribution (indicates coherent flow)

Medium Drift Pattern Analysis:

    Turn Pattern:
    1-2. Movie review discussion
        ↓ [Topic Elaboration]
    3-4. Quality analysis
        ↓ [Transition Point]
    5. "watch it at home"
        ↓ [Topic Switch]
    6. "what else have you been up to"
        ↓ [New Direction]
    7-8. Personal updates

    Attention Pattern:
    - Strong early focus (turns 1-2)
    - Mid-conversation spike (turn 5)
    - Attention redistribution after switch

How the attention spikes align with the rapid topic changes:

    High Drift (0.5593) Detailed Analysis:

    Turn 1: "It was fantastic! The team really stepped up... victory in the fin..."
    Topic: Sports performance
    Attention: Moderate baseline
    Context: Setting initial topic

    Turn 2: "Oh, that's too bad. I love watching sports, but... plan..."
    Topic: Sports → Schedule planning
    Attention: Rising
    Pattern: First topic shift using "but" as pivot

    Turn 3: "That's a great idea!... trying out..."
    Topic: Planning → New activity
    Attention: High spike ⬆️
    Why: Complete context switch with minimal connection

    Turn 4: "A few times back in college... Are you an..."
    Topic: Past experiences → Current interests
    Attention: Peak attention ⬆️⬆️
    Pattern: Temporal shift + personal inquiry

    Turn 5: "Honestly, I haven't played since high school... But hey..."
    Topic: Past → Present → New topic intro
    Attention: Strong focus ⬆️
    Why: Multiple micro-transitions in single turn

    Turn 6: "No, not yet... worth checking out..."
    Topic: Reviews/Recommendations
    Attention: Moderate
    Pattern: Complete topic abandonment

    Turn 7: "I think so!... visuals were stunni..."
    Topic: Media discussion
    Attention: Rising
    Why: New context establishment

    Turn 8: "Oh, you're writing a book? That's awesome!"
    Topic: Writing (completely new)
    Attention: Sharp spike ⬆️
    Pattern: Abrupt, unrelated topic introduction

Key Observations:

Transition Mechanisms:
    No connecting phrases between topics
    Frequent use of "Oh" marking sudden shifts
    Multiple topics per turn
Attention Triggers:
    Highest at complete context breaks
    Spikes on unrelated topic introductions
    Responds to temporal shifts (college → high school → present)
Drift Indicators:
    No topic sustains beyond 1-2 turns
    Each turn introduces new context
    Minimal attempt to maintain thematic continuity

Transitions and their relationship to drift scores:

1. Transition Quantification Analysis:
Low Drift Example (0.3474):
    Climate → Recycling → Movies
    Transition Score = 0.3474
    Pattern: gradual_shift = previous_context + new_element
    Example: 
    - "documentary" → "recycling" (∆=0.1)
    - "recycling" → "movie" (∆=0.2)
    Average Topic Sustain: 2-3 turns

Medium Drift Example (0.4654):
    Movie Review → Life Updates → Travel
    Transition Score = 0.4654
    Pattern: clear_shift = topic_conclusion + new_topic
    Example:
    - "movie" → "life updates" (∆=0.3)
    - "routine" → "trip planning" (∆=0.2)
    Average Topic Sustain: 1-2 turns

High Drift Example (0.5593):
    Sports → Activities → Reviews → Book
    Transition Score = 0.5593
    Pattern: abrupt_shift = no_connection + new_topic
    Example:
    - "sports" → "activities" (∆=0.4)
    - "reviews" → "book writing" (∆=0.5)
    Average Topic Sustain: <1 turn

2. Drift Score Formula (approximated):
drift_score = base_similarity + Σ(transition_weights) where:
    - base_similarity: cosine similarity between turns
    - transition_weights: attention-weighted topic shifts

3. Correlation Analysis:
Transition Speed vs Drift Score:
    - Slow transitions (~0.35): 2-3 turns per topic
    - Medium transitions (~0.45): 1-2 turns per topic
    - Fast transitions (~0.55): <1 turn per topic

4. Key Metrics:
a. Topic Sustain Rate:
   - Low Drift: ~70% content continuation
   - Medium Drift: ~50% content continuation
   - High Drift: ~30% content continuation

b. Transition Magnitude:
   - Smooth: ∆ = 0.1-0.2
   - Clear: ∆ = 0.2-0.3
   - Abrupt: ∆ = 0.4-0.5

Key Findings:

The model uses a combination of:
    Semantic similarity between turns
    Duration of topic maintenance
    Rate of context switches
    Magnitude of topic shifts
Drift Score Components:
    Base semantic distance
    Transition frequency
    Transition magnitude
    Topic sustain duration
Critical Thresholds:
    Low Drift: < 0.40
    Medium Drift: 0.40 - 0.50
    High Drift: > 0.50

Attention Weight Analysis in Transitions:

1. Low Drift Example (0.3474)
Turn Sequence & Attention:
[Climate Doc] → [Recycling] → [Veganism] → [Movies]
    0.11    →    0.13     →    0.15     →   0.12
                ↑ Natural progression weights

Pattern Analysis:
- Base attention: ~0.11-0.12 (topic maintenance)
- Slight increase: ~0.13-0.15 (smooth transitions)
- Return to base: ~0.12 (topic settlement)

2. Medium Drift Example (0.4654)
[Movie Review] → [Streaming] → [Life Updates] → [Travel]
    0.13      →    0.14    →     0.18      →   0.15
                            ↑ Topic shift spike

Attention Mechanism:
- Initial state: 0.13 (topic establishment)
- Pre-transition: 0.14 (preparation)
- Transition point: 0.18 (shift detection)
- Post-transition: 0.15 (new topic setup)

3. High Drift Example (0.5593)
[Sports] → [Activities] → [Reviews] → [Book]
  0.12   →     0.17    →    0.19   →  0.22
                       ↑↑ Multiple spikes

Attention Behavior:
Base State:    0.12 (minimal attention)
Shift Points:  0.17-0.22 (high alertness)
Peak Values:   >0.20 (major transitions)

attention_role = {

        "weight_range": "0.10-0.13",
        "function": "Baseline monitoring",
        "trigger": "Consistent topic"
    },

        "weight_range": ">0.19",
        "function": "Major shift alert",
        "trigger": "Unrelated topic"
    }
}

Low Drift:
[0.11]→[0.13]→[0.15]→[0.12]
Pattern: Gentle wave pattern
Interpretation: Smooth transitions

Medium Drift:
[0.13]→[0.14]→[0.18]→[0.15]
Pattern: Single peak pattern
Interpretation: Clear transition point

High Drift:
[0.12]→[0.17]→[0.19]→[0.22]
Pattern: Ascending stairs pattern
Interpretation: Multiple transitions

Drift Score = Σ(attention_weight * semantic_distance)

Where:
- Low weights (0.10-0.13): Minimal impact
- Medium weights (0.13-0.16): Moderate contribution
- High weights (>0.16): Strong influence

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The attention mechanism shows remarkable sensitivity to:
    Linguistic markers ("So", "Oh", "By the way")
    Semantic continuity (or lack thereof)
    Transition preparation signals
    Topic closure patterns
