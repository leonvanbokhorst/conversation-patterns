Model Performance Metrics:
    Training converged well with excellent metrics:
    Test RMSE: 0.0105 (very low, indicating high precision)
    Test R²: 0.8932 (strong correlation between predictions and actual values)
    Best Validation R²: 0.8955 (consistent with test results, no overfitting)

Training Curves Analysis:

Loss curves show healthy convergence:
    Both training and validation losses decrease smoothly
    Small gap between train/val curves indicates good generalization
    No significant oscillations suggesting stable learning

R² Score curves:
    Steady improvement reaching ~0.90
    Validation R² closely follows training, confirming model robustness

Prediction Distribution:

Scatter plot shows:
    Strong alignment with the ideal prediction line
    Tighter clustering around middle drift values (0.4-0.6)
    Slight spread at extremes (very high/low drift)

Error distribution:
    Approximately normal distribution
    Centered near zero
    Small standard deviation (~0.02)

Attention Analysis by Drift Level:

a. Low Drift (0.3474):
    Topic: Climate documentary → Superhero movie
    Pattern: "Gentle wave" transition
    Key markers: "by the way", "Hey", "Oh"
    Natural flow with related subtopics
    Attention weights show gradual shifts
b. Medium Drift (0.4654):
    Topic: Movie review → Personal life
    Pattern: "Single peak" transition at Turn 6
    Key marker: "So, what else"
    Clear topic boundary but smooth transition
    Higher attention weights at transition points
c. High Drift (0.5593):
    Topic: Sports → Book writing
    Pattern: "Ascending stairs" with multiple shifts
    Multiple transition markers: "Speaking of", "But hey", "Oh"
    Rapid topic changes
    Highest attention weights at major shifts

Model's Strengths:
    Accurate drift score prediction
    Effective attention mechanism
    Good pattern recognition
    Robust semantic bridge detection

Areas for Potential Enhancement:
Pattern Recognition:
    Add more granular transition patterns
    Weight linguistic markers dynamically
