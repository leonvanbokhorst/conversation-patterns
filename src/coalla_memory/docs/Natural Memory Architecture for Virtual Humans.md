# Vision Document: Natural Memory Architecture for Virtual Humans

## Context & Goals

We aim to create a more natural and human-like virtual agent by implementing the CoALA (Cognitive Architectures for Language Agents) memory framework. The key innovation is moving beyond simple context windows to a structured, multi-layered memory system that allows for more natural and contextually aware interactions.

## Core Memory Architecture

### 1. Working Memory

- **Purpose**: Maintains active conversation state and current context
- **Implementation**: LangChain's ConversationBufferMemory
- **Key Features**:
  - Holds immediate context of conversation
  - Manages active goals and current focus
  - Limited capacity (like human working memory)

### 2. Episodic Memory

- **Purpose**: Stores personal experiences and past interactions
- **Implementation**: LangChain's ConversationSummaryMemory with Redis
- **Key Features**:
  - Maintains conversation history with summaries
  - Enables recall of specific past interactions
  - Supports learning from past experiences

### 3. Semantic Memory

- **Purpose**: Stores general knowledge and learned facts
- **Implementation**: Vector store (to be implemented)
- **Key Features**:
  - Knowledge base of facts and concepts
  - Contextual retrieval of relevant information
  - Ability to learn and update knowledge

### 4. Procedural Memory

- **Purpose**: Stores skills and action patterns
- **Implementation**: Tool/function registry
- **Key Features**:
  - Available actions and capabilities
  - Learned patterns and behaviors
  - Skill acquisition and refinement

## Natural Interaction Patterns

The memory architecture supports several key interaction patterns:

1. **Contextual Awareness**
   - Drawing on past conversations when relevant
   - Remembering user preferences and history
   - Maintaining conversation continuity

2. **Natural Learning**
   - Learning from conversations
   - Updating knowledge base
   - Acquiring new skills and behaviors

3. **Adaptive Responses**
   - Contextually appropriate recall
   - Experience-informed decisions
   - Personalized interactions

## Implementation Priorities

1. **Phase 1: Core Memory Systems**
   - Set up working memory with conversation buffer
   - Implement episodic memory with Redis
   - Basic retrieval mechanisms

2. **Phase 2: Knowledge Integration**
   - Implement semantic memory with vector store
   - Knowledge base population
   - Contextual retrieval system

3. **Phase 3: Skill System**
   - Procedural memory implementation
   - Tool registration system
   - Skill learning mechanisms

4. **Phase 4: Integration & Refinement**
   - Memory interaction patterns
   - Performance optimization
   - Natural forgetting mechanisms

## Expected Outcomes

1. More coherent long-term interactions
2. Better context awareness and recall
3. Natural learning and adaptation
4. Improved personalization
5. More human-like conversation patterns

## Technical Requirements

1. Redis instance for persistent storage
2. Vector store for semantic memory
3. LangChain integration
4. Efficient retrieval mechanisms
5. Memory management systems
